[www]
# This defines a pool named www. Each pool can have its own settings,
# and you can define multiple pools with different configurations if needed.

user = www-data
# This sets the user under which the PHP-FPM processes will run.
# www-data is a common user for web services to improve security and isolation.

group = www-data
# This sets the group under which the PHP-FPM processes will run.
# Matching the group to the user ensures consistent permissions and access controls.

listen = 9000
# This specifies the address and port on which the PHP-FPM service will listen for incoming
# FastCGI requests. In this case, it is set to listen on port 9000 on all available interfaces.

pm = dynamic
# This sets the process management (pm) mode to dynamic. In dynamic mode,
# the number of child processes is adjusted dynamically based on the current load.

pm.max_children = 5
# This specifies the maximum number of child processes that can be alive at the same time.
# This limits the number of concurrent requests the PHP-FPM pool can handle.

pm.start_servers = 2
# This specifies the number of child processes to create when starting.
# Having a couple of child processes pre-started can reduce response times for the first few requests.

pm.min_spare_servers = 1
# This specifies the minimum number of idle (not currently handling a request) child processes.
# If the number of idle processes falls below this number, new child processes will be created.

pm.max_spare_servers = 3
# This specifies the maximum number of idle child processes. If the number of idle processes exceeds this number,
# some of them will be killed. This helps manage memory and system resource usage efficiently.

chdir = /
# This sets the current working directory for the PHP-FPM process to the root directory (/).
# This ensures the process has a known starting point for relative paths.

catch_workers_output = yes
# This setting ensures that any output (e.g., error messages, warnings) from the child processes is caught
# and redirected to the main error log. This is useful for debugging and monitoring.
